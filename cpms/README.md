# CPMS - Work In Progress

`/site` contains the front end.
`/contracts` are the contracts.


CPMSStamp1155 maintains a collection of CPMS Stamps.

All metadata is on-chain, include the base64 encoded tiny GIF image.

This enables the CPMS Letter to be bound to a CPMS Stamp, and render the stamp in its view.

CPMS Letter contract is in progress.
