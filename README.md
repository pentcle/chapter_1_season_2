we made you a minipent. 

https://canto.minipent.xyz


this means you now have a database, which you can post data to via a cms, and you can download and back up with your org. so, if your team all download the minipent db (we've prepared the scripts), regularly, it's a distributed system. 

here is the video:

we have logins for you for your minipent and are interested in understanding your org requirements for distributing information (more than we expect you to use it - we are in super early testing :) )
